# BookBazaar

BookBazaar is a web3 project in Internet Computer developed using the Motoko language(backend) during the Internet Computer Internship Bootcamp. It is a web application where users can register and log in to buy, sell, or exchange their used books. The platform aims to facilitate the exchange of books among users, promoting literacy, recycling, and economic benefits.



## Purpose

The purpose of BookBazaar is to provide a platform where users can easily sell or exchange their used books with others. This not only helps users declutter their bookshelves but also allows them to earn some money by selling books they no longer need. Additionally, by exchanging books, users can explore new genres and expand their knowledge without spending money on new books.

## Functionality

### User Registration and Login

Users can register on the platform by providing their name, last name, email, and password. After registration, users can log in to their accounts using their email and password.

### Add New Book

Logged-in users can add new books to the platform by providing details such as the title, author, condition, and situation (e.g., available for sale or exchange).

### Request to Buy or Exchange Books

Users can browse through the available books on the platform and make requests to buy or exchange books with other users. When a request is made, the owner of the book receives a notification, and they can choose to accept or reject the request.

### Confirm Exchange

If the owner accepts the exchange request, the exchange is confirmed, and the book's status is updated accordingly. Users can update the condition of the book if necessary.
